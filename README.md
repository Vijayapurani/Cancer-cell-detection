Detecting cancer cell using CNN and transfer learning methods

Data source : Kaggle

The data set is imbalanced with around 60 % being non-malignant.  3 models - 2 using CNN and 1 using  ResNEt were built and evaluated. Recall is used for evaluating the model performance. None of the model's metric stabilized at the end of 60 epochs . A recall of 73(approx) was obtained on the test set.  The model has to be further finetuned to get better results.
